# Qt client side window decorations demo

Project to test WIP API for
[QTBUG-73011](https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-73011).

Currently it depends on Qt 5.13 branch, and these patches:

- https://codereview.qt-project.org/219277
- https://codereview.qt-project.org/249758
- https://codereview.qt-project.org/249855 (resize on Wayland)

Should work on Wayland, X11 and most likely Windows (untested).
