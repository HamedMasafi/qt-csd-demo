# Qt client side window decorations demo

Depends on Qt 5.13 branch, and these patches:

- https://codereview.qt-project.org/219277
- https://codereview.qt-project.org/249758
- https://codereview.qt-project.org/249855 (resize on Wayland)

Should work on Wayland, X11 and most likely Windows (untested).
